    <h3>one stop freelancer</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I have many different passions and practiced skills in many areas of work which has always made it difficult to decide on just one career. Over the years I have searched for positions that allowed for creativity and analytics; and believe it or not, it is much harder than it seems to find such a role that exists. I have held many different professional positions: from graphic designer, to project manager, to banker. I also can't deny that I love to work hands-on with all of my projects.</p>
    <p> My passion for writing and graphic design began over twelve years ago. I discovered early on that I had a passion and talent for the creative, but it hadn't occurred to me at that point that I could make a career out of it. This led me to pursue careers in mathematics, accounting, and business; because I had also been very strongly pulled by the left side of my brain. It took until my junior year of college to discover that I could do both. It's almost comical, because in hind-sight, of course you can do both! But, things seem narrow and one tracked when you are deciding the fate of your future haha.</p>
    <p> Fast forward after obtaining my bachelor's degree, and I couldn't ignore the urges of wanting to do so many different things, and being good at them! It was then I decided that I wanted to offer myself as a one-stop freelancer. I allow clients to keep the majority of their projects in one place. Between my event coordination, project management, design skills, writing abilities, and printing; I can help business achieve their goals in a concise and trusted fashion.</p>
    <p>Imagine your company is about to rebrand themselves. Not only would I be able to design a new logo and branding kit, as well as new marketing material; but I could contribute to the copy, get all your items printed, and coordinate your launch party! I use strategic outsource management to provide seamless demonstrations both remotely and locally.</p>
    <p>I believe, not only do my skill sets allow me to have success in the industry, but my passion as well. If anthything can set me apart, it is my deep love for everything I do.</p>
